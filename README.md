Tools and tips to enhance some of the work on your unmanaged laptop with
the managed astronet machines.

Currently (2022) the managed astronet machines run redhat 8.5.

For unmanaged machines, we have experimented with:

* (K)Ubuntu 20.04 [peter, marc]
* (K)Ubuntu 22.04 [peter]
* Redhat 8.5 [kevin]
* Mac OSX 10.15.7 (catalina) [peter]

Typical things we use/test:

* ssh
* printing
* x2go (still some issues with mac)
* amount (sshfs mounting of managed disks)
